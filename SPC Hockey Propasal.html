            <h2>Subject: Request for Support to Develop St. Peter’s College Hockey and Achieve Excellence in Island-Wide Competitions</h2>
            <p>Dear Members of the Old Boys’ Union,</p>
            <p>I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. As the coach of the St. Peter’s College Hockey Team, I am reaching out to seek your invaluable support in enhancing the standard of hockey at our school. Our aim is to bring the Peterite hockey program to greater heights, eventually securing at least one All-Island Trophy championship every year, representing the excellence of St. Peter’s College on the national stage.</p>
            
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>To achieve at least one All-Island Hockey Championship in every category annually, ensuring that St. Peter's College maintains its status as a premier institution in the sport of hockey.</p>
            
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to foster a culture of excellence, discipline, and teamwork through hockey, by nurturing young talent from the grassroots level and providing them with the skills, opportunities, and guidance necessary to excel. We are committed to developing well-rounded athletes who not only succeed on the field but also carry the values of St. Peter's College—integrity, perseverance, and sportsmanship—into every aspect of their lives.</p>
            <p>In order to achieve this goal, we have identified several key areas where we need assistance and support from the Old Boys’ Union. The following outlines the steps we plan to take and the support we request:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section proposal-content">
            <h2>1) Recruitment of Junior Players</h2>
            <p>We aim to recruit talented young players from grades 3-5 to ensure a strong pipeline of future talent. The recruitment process will be managed during school hours (with the necessary permission from the school administration), focusing on two days: Tuesday and Thursday mornings. We plan to recruit at least 100 players initially. After recruitment, we will conduct regular training sessions on weekdays and weekends (Saturday mornings). Given the large number of players, we request the support of the Old Boys' Union to help manage and facilitate these sessions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section proposal-content">
            <h2>2) Inter-House Tournament</h2>
            <p>To foster healthy competition and identify budding talent, we propose to organize an Inter-House Hockey Tournament at the beginning of each year. This will be held in three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Age Group 1</strong></li>
                <li><strong>College Age Group 2</strong></li>
                <li><strong>College Open Category</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The tournament will serve as a platform for young players to showcase their skills, while also building team spirit and camaraderie among the students.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section proposal-content">
            <h2>3) Inter-School Encounters</h2>
            <p>To improve the competitive edge of our teams, we propose organizing at least three encounters with other schools each year. In addition, we would like to organize a match with an outstation team for each of the three age groups. These encounters will either be hosted at our school or played as away games. The matches will help players gain valuable experience, sharpen their competitive spirit, and enhance their performance during tournaments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section proposal-content">
            <h2>4) Monthly Coaching Camps</h2>
            <p>We plan to organize a coaching camp once every month, providing players with intensive training, skill development, and practice matches. These camps will also be tailored to meet the needs of specific age groups, especially if there are upcoming tournaments. During these camps, we request the support of Old Boys who have played the sport at a high level to assist with coaching, mentoring, and managing the various age groups.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section proposal-content">
            <h2>5) Colombo Club Tournament Representation</h2>
            <p>To further develop the skills of our senior players and expose them to competitive environments, we seek permission and support for our College Team to represent St. Peter's College in the Colombo Club Hockey Tournament (OPSC). Participating in this tournament will allow our players to gain experience, build teamwork, and improve their performance at a higher level of competition, benefiting both individual players and the school team as a whole.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section proposal-content">
            <h2>Conclusion and Request for Support</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, we believe that with your continued support, we can raise the standard of hockey at St. Peter’s College and develop a team that consistently performs at the national level. Our vision is not only to win titles but also to instill values such as teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship in our players.</p>
            <p>We look forward to discussing this proposal further and receiving your support in making this vision a reality.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
            <p><strong>Yours sincerely,</strong><br>Jiffery Irshad<br>Coach, St. Peter’s College Hockey Team</p>
